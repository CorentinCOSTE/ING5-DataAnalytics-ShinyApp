Titanic dataset
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(Titanic[, , Age = "Adult", Survived = "Yes"])
knitr::kable(Titanic[, , Age = "Child", Survived = "Yes"])
```

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(Titanic[, , Age = "Adult", Survived = "No"])
knitr::kable(Titanic[, , Age = "Child", Survived = "No"])
```

User inputs for the dashboard
========================================================

One can choose a set of values for these field, and compare it to another set of values

- **Survived**
- **Age**
- **Sex**

Example : *Yes/Adult/Female* v.s. *No/Adult/Female*

Example of plot
========================================================
left:30%
**Blue bars:** How many female adults survived the Titanic

**Red bars:** How many female adults did not survive the Titanic

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x    <- Titanic
values <- rbind( x[, Sex = "Female", Age = "Adult", Survived = "Yes"], x[, Sex = "Female", Age = "Adult", Survived = "No"] ) 
barplot(values, main = "Survived by Class", names.arg = names(values), xlab = "Class", ylab = "Counts", col = c("darkblue","red"), beside=TRUE)
```


Explaination of the example
========================================================
left:30%
We can observe that a woman chance of surviving increases as her class increases.

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x    <- Titanic
values <- rbind( x[, Sex = "Female", Age = "Adult", Survived = "Yes"], x[, Sex = "Female", Age = "Adult", Survived = "No"] ) 
barplot(values, main = "Survived by Class", names.arg = names(values), xlab = "Class", ylab = "Counts", col = c("darkblue","red"), beside=TRUE)
```
